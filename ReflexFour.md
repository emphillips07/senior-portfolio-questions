The professional organization that I want to be a part of is the Association for Computing Machinery. 
ACM is the largest organization that focuses on computer science, its development, and its consequences. 
I have had plenty of exposure to their philosophy and resources while studying at CSU, and I know they 
would provide an immense number of resources to aid me in my profession. The best part about ACM is that 
they really strive to make their members and computer science better for everyone. They offer guidelines 
for ethics in the science, scholarships for students, research about cutting-edge technologies, and more. 
It would really benefit my career in every aspect to be a part of their organization.
    Professional development is a crucial part of the computer science industry. With the constant changes 
to computers and software, continual education is necessary to remain up to date with the latest information. 
I do see myself enrolling in a masterâ€™s program during my professional career, but I do not see that happening 
in the next five years. One of the ways that I want to hone my skills is through obtaining certifications. One 
is the IEEE Certifications. It deals with the software lifecycle and application development. While looking at 
jobs, I have seen many that prefer/require it. Outside of the computer science realm, there are many resources 
to develop other skills such as time management and teamwork. There are plenty of resources that deal with these 
topics, but I have been looking at an author by the name of Clayton M. Christensen. He is a Harvard professor 
that has written many books explaining strategies of how to be successful in the workplace through various means.
