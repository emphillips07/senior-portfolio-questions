    There are many ways that the skills that I have learned in CS can serve the community. In a direct line, my goal is to work 
for the DoD in quality assurance and testing. The program skills and information could help aid our service members, even as 
much as saving lives. When I obtain this goal, I am going to be able to serve those that serve our community.
    Outside of that, there are other ways that I can serve the community with my learned CS skills. Some of those skills are 
derived from the ethics papers and research that are part of the curriculum. The ethics assignments have covered a broad array 
of items that can be implement towards my professional career and community. Ensuring that I am honest with my work, I hold my 
company accountable, and practice sustainable practices will help serve the community that I am apart of. It will benefit the 
community that I am living in and working with, but it will also help my CSU community. Showing that I have been taught these 
ethical practices will maintain the reputation that CSU has, helping all my fellow alumni when they graduate and take on the real 
world.
