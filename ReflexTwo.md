An example of a time that I worked with a team would be for my Object-Oriented Programming class. The class included a 
large project that was to be completed by a group of six. We had taken this class during the summer semester, so the 
typical timespan of a fourteen-week class was cut in half. The project itself was open ended. We were able to come up 
with what the project was, if it included items that were learned during the semester. We created a program that would 
manage the inventory for a business and would allow the user to edit details about the inventory. Despite the accelerated 
schedule, we completed the project within all the given deadlines and received and A for our efforts.
    I work very well in group settings. I ensure that any tasks that are designated are mine be completed thoroughly and on 
time. My instill confidence in my team members that I am going do my part and going to do it well. I make sure to let my 
teammate know that I am available for discussion, assistance, or feedback when it is needed. I am also as flexible as I
possibly can with my role and my time. Free time is not always easy to come by, but I am more then willing to dedicate it 
to working and collaborating with my team members.
    The biggest area for improvement with my team skills would involve my communication. I make sure that my team members know 
that I am open to discussions, but I could the one to prompt the discussions more often. I find myself making sure that 
everyone gets to share their thoughts and ideas, and that can lead me to holding onto mine. This has led me to hold onto my 
ideas that could have benefitted the team.
