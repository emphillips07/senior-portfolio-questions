The career in CS that I am most suited for is quality assurance/tester in software development. My favorite 
thing to do with things like video games and apps is to find the bugs in them. At first, it was finding them 
through use of the app. As I have furthered my education, I find myself being able to go though the code of these 
apps and finding the bugs or exploits that can be caused. It gives me a weird since of accomplishment when I can 
find a problem that can be exploited. 
    This career suites me better for a few reasons. The first is that I am more passionate about code and software 
than I am about hardware and networks. While I know they are important, I do not enjoy working with them as much as 
I do with code and software. The reason why I want to work more towards software development instead if a computer 
programmer is the current job market projection. It seems that the job market for programmers has been on the decline 
for some time now. The jobs are being offshored to other countries that can provide the labor for cheaper wages. A 
big reason for me going back to get my education was because my current career showed that there was not as much 
security in it as I thought. If I am going to invest all these resources into moving into a new career, I want to 
ensure that I have job security.
    QA and testing will provide me with job security. A companyâ€™s reputation relies on the products and services that 
they provide and how dependable they are. On top of that, incredible amounts of information are being entered into 
software and programs that could be detrimental if it was compromised. I would be finding the vulnerabilities before 
they could become a problem, which is something that will always be needed.
